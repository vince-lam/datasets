# Datasets

Repo to store small datasets used in my projects or blog tutorials.

* Datasets less than 50 MB (GitHub's file size limit) will be stored as a `csv` or `zip` file.
* Datasets larger than 50 MB will be converted to a `parquet` file and stored here if the converted file size is less than 50 MB.
* Otherwise the dataset URL will be provided and audience will need to create an API to download the data from the URL.
